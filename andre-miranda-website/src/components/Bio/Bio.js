            I'm {calculateAge()} years old and I was born in the sunny and beautiful Portugal.

            Curious by Nature, I always enjoy learning new stuff and getting things done.
            Since I can remember, I've been seeking for answers in all range of topics.
          </p>
          <p>I have the will to try new challenges, pushing myself to grow and be a better person everyday.</p>
          <p>
            I'm currently living in Lisbon but it's in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className={classes.Link} href="https://goo.gl/maps/xxbrgYwRgpQg1ACP6">Gi√µes</a> where I like to spend my free time.
            Located between Algarve and Alentejo, this small village is my grandfather's birthplace
             and where I love to be close to Nature. There I use to go fishing in my kayak, hiking,
              and hang with my family and friends.

              Sports are also one of my passions, I played basketball for some years including for my University.
              I'm a F.C. Porto fan so I don't miss any game! Besides that, I'm always in for a match, a bike ride or some kayaking.
            </p>

              My creative side, useful for software development as well, makes me enjoying going to music concerts,
               visiting museums, watching cinema masterpieces, reading good books and follow remarkable artists.
              I'm also a listener of food for thought Podcasts, where new visions of the world
               and perspectives are discussed.
               I hope that some day soon I'll have the time to explore my own habilities on these subjects.
